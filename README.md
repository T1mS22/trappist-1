# Welcome to the repo of my personal website.

You might ask why the name of the repo is `trappist-1`. Here is the answer you are looking for:

Very simple, i really like space and everything around it. A while ago i decided that i want to name all of my future projects after exoplanets. You can read more about the Trappist-1 system [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1).

Feel free to explore my progress in learning UI development.
